# webpack-demos

This repo contains webpack demos for various configuration options. The first 11 examples are each loosely taken from the [webpack guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/). I've added links to appropriate sections of the guides in each directory's README if you would like to follow along or do additional reading.

The final examples are larger apps that take into account multiple different principles for creating a robust webpack config.
