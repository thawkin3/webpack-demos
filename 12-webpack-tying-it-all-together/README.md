# Tying It All Together

## Overview

This example pulls in all of the different concepts that have been explored in the previous examples. It includes:

- asset management for css, images, fonts, csv files, and xml files
- output management to dynamically create the `index.html` file and to clean the `dist` directory with each build
- separate webpack configs for development and production
- development servers
- a single entrypoint, but lazy loading with dynamic imports for code splitting
- separate bundles for vendor code
- bundle analysis
- tree shaking

For more in depth explanations of each concept, please see the individual example READMEs that precede this example.
